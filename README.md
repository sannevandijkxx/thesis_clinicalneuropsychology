Hello reader of my analyses scripts! 
I would like to help you a bit in case you would like to redo my analyses :-)! 
The datasets are named similarly to the Rscripts related to the analysis (aka, "sent_analysis.csv" is the dataset related to the "Sentiment analysis" Rscript.

Additionally, the DTD-Code Manager shows all of the codes I added to my created categories. Later, I will also add my codebook, in which I will provide my process and my reasoning behind the specific codes!

I hope this helps and I also hope I did my analyses correctly!

Kind Regards,
